Project created to show my skills to work with Angular 5 (at the moment when I start and 8 at middle of 2019 and after a 4 projects successfully delivered to clients)

Idea is in creating an app to fill remote DB with data in key-value pairs and then quiz knowledge on this pairs in another part of app.
Idea created and growed from test task sent to me from one of companies I've tried to join couple of years ago.
